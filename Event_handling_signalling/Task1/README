Description
###############################

This program implements setjmp and longjmp to demonstrate an example imprecise computation programming 
pattern in which executing computation will be terminated and the existing results are put out when we 
double click the right mouse button.

The imprecise computation done in this program is finding the sum of the first 'n' even numbers where 'n' 
is the number of times the loop will run until the signal is generated when the double click event of 
right mouse button is captured.

A POSIX thread is created in which the mouse double click event is captured and then the signal is delivered
in whose handler longjmp is handled. The return type '-1' from longjmp terminates the program and outputs the 
sum of the even numbers calculated till then.

Steps to execute
###############################

#Open the terminal and run the following command 
	sudo -s

#Enter the root password
	
#Run the following command
	cat /proc/bus/input/devices 
 and note the event number '#' for the input device mouse from the list of input devices
 
#Open the main.c file and in line number 38, enter the event number '#' noted in the previous step in "/dev/input/event#"

#Open the current directory having the files downloaded in the terminal and run the following command
	bash task1.sh

#Double click the right mouse button to see the imprecise computed result
