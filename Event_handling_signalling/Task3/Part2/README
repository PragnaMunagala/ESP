Description
###############################

In this part a library is built that allows SIGIO signal being delivered to all threads that are registered 
to receive the signal.

In the main program, five threads are created and in the thread function register_threads() function from sig_lib.c 
is called to register the even numbered threads out of the five threads to receive the signal.

The mouse left click event is used to trigger the SIGIO signal from the thread function and in the signal handler,
handle_threads() function from sig_lib.c library is being called to deliver the SIGIO signal to all the registered 
threads.

The printf statement in handle_threads() in sig_lib.c is to display the thread ids of the registered threads to which
the signal is being delivered.

The printf statement in the signal handler function in main.c is to display the thread ids of the threads calling the
signal handler. The display of this printf in the terminal will be asynchronous as it is written outside of mutex_lock
as IO commands should not be inside the lock.

Steps to execute
###############################

#Open the terminal and run the following command 
	sudo -s

#Enter the root password
	
#Run the following command
	cat /proc/bus/input/devices 
 and note the event number '#' for the input device mouse from the list of input devices
 
#Open the main.c file and in line number 45, enter the event number '#' noted in the previous step in "/dev/input/event#"

#Open the current directory having the files downloaded in the terminal and run the following commands
	make
	./part2

#Click the left button of mouse to generate the SIGIO signal and the printf statements as mentioned in the above description
will be displayed.

#Press ctrl+c to terminate the program.
