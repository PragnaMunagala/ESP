This program shows the following statement is true for SIGIO signal
	“A process-directed signal may be delivered to any one of the threads
	that does not currently have the signal blocked. If more than one of the threads has the signal unblocked,
	then the kernel chooses an arbitrary thread to which to deliver the signal.”

Five threads are created in this program and process id of the arbitrary thread to which the signal will be delivered
is displayed using printf in the signal handler.
