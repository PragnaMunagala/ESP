This program implements a libary to perform page read and write operations performed on a 24FC256 EEPROM using I2C device that is accessed from the user space. 
We are implementing five functions to initialise, read, write, erase and setting the current page position. 
This library program uses the i2c-dev driver modules to work with I2C devices in linux. This library program also lights up the led when a read or write operation is taking place.

Steps to execute
###############################

#Connect the board to a host and setup a serial connection between the host and the board.
#Retrieve the IP address of the board.
#Login to the board and create a directory namely "part1" using the command "mkdir part1". 
#Copy the files EEPROM.c, EEPROM.h, main.c, Makefile from their current directory to the board using the command scp <filename> root@<IP address>:home/root/part1
#Now on the serial terminal that is accessing the board enter into the part1 directory using the command "cd part1".
#Now type the following commands to execute the program and obtain the result.

#make
#./final

#To clean final executables, run:
#make clean
