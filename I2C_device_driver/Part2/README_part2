This program defines an i2c-client driver module for the EEPROM(flash device)  to invoke user calls to perform read and write operations performed on a 24FC256 EEPROM.
This driver module supports five calls namely open, read, write, ioctl and close and has the suport for the operation of blocking read and write calls.
This driver program also lights up the led when a read or write operation is taking place.

Steps to execute
###############################

#On the host machine, place the files i2c_flash.c, main.c, make into a directory. From the same directory type the command "make".
#Now you are able to see the i2c_flash.ko file in the same directory. 
#Connect the board to a host and setup a serial connection between the host and the board.
#Retrieve the IP address of the board.
#Login to the board and create a directory namely "part2" using the command "mkdir part2". 
#on the user terminal run the 'make' command
#Copy the files i2c_flash.ko, main.c from their current directory to the board using the command scp <filename> root@<IP address>:home/root/part2
#Now on the serial terminal that is accessing the board enter into the part2 directory using the command "cd part2".
#Now insert the driver module by typing the command "insmod i2c_flash.ko"
#Type the following commands to execute the program and get the result.
#gcc -c main.c 
#gcc -o final main.o
#./final
